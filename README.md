# EyeInteraction
This is an interactive web character whose eyes follow the mouse cursor. 
I created this project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.


# Overview
This project animates a character's pupils based on the user's mouse movement.
Pupils react smoothly, giving a sense of life to the face illustration. 


# Technologies used
- HTML : basic layout and image placement
- CSS : Styling and font design using Google Fonts
- JavaScript : Real-time mouse tracking and Pupil movement
